# C2-Blockchain
This is a C2 Implemented over Ethereum Smart Contracts based on Ropsten TestNet Server<br/>
To read more about how we made this poc please refer to the series [here](https://sarthaksaini.com/2019/August/Blockchain/parts/1/Introduction.html).

We have Explained everything from introduction of blockchain to Using smart contracts over python

## Installation

*Note:- This is just a proof of concept so the virus.py would require web3 to be installed on target server but this limitation can be rectified if the virus was made in Go so that an attacker could link the web3 files with the virus binary itself*

pip3 install web3

## USAGE:-

python3 handler.py

*Note:- The data which will be transferred over the blockchain can be publically accessed by anyone who has the wallet address of contract so Don't try to pass any sensitive data and to rectify that you can implement a encryption before sending data to or from attacker*
